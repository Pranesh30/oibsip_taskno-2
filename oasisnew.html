                <P>Here you can create the backend of an e-commerce website. Set-up payments, the library of products that need to be sold, inventory and more. All you need is the basic interface of a shop on the front end. You can complete this in a week itself. If you are interested in this and want to take this a step further, you can go all the way into user authentication. Make a really complex inventory system or a shopping cart system. By creating a secure website, processing payments, etc you are basically communicating a lot about your skill sets.

This site is to show an appealing, high converting landing page. The key is to make it look visually pleasing. You can work for companies that need a landing page. This is a great secondary skill that one can possess.</P>

This pop up usually broadcasts an offer or something of value to keep you hooked onto the site. The best part is that the content is customisable based on how long the user has spent time on the website</p>
